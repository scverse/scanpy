Scanpy – Single-Cell Analysis in Python
=======================================

Scanpy is a scalable toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data.
It includes preprocessing, visualization, clustering, pseudotime and trajectory
inference and differential expression testing. The Python-based implementation
efficiently deals with datasets of more than one million cells.
