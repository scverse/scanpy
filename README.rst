Scanpy â€“ Single-Cell Analysis in Python
=======================================

Scanpy is a scalable toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data
built jointly with `anndata <https://anndata.readthedocs.io>`__.  It includes
preprocessing, visualization, clustering, trajectory inference and differential
expression testing.  The Python-based implementation efficiently deals with
datasets of more than one million cells.
