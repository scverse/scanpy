If you'd like to see your tool included here, please open a [pull request](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy)!

With *ecosystem*, we mean the broader single-cell related tools that operate on {class}`~anndata.AnnData`.
If your tool doesn't do this, but is useful for analysing single cell data we also accept light wrappers for some tools in {mod}`scanpy.external`.

  > Squidpy is a comprehensive toolkit for working with spatial single cell omics data.

- [PASTE](https://github.com/raphael-group/paste) {small}`Princeton`

  > PASTE is a computational method to align and integrate spatial transcriptomics data across adjacent tissue slices by leveraging both gene expression similarity and spatial distances between spots.

### Multimodal integration

- [MUON](https://muon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [MuData](https://mudata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) {small}`EMBL/ DKFZ`

  > MUON, and it's associated data structure MuData are designed to organise, analyse, visualise, and exchange multimodal data.
  > MUON enables a range of analyses for ATAC and CITE-seq, from data preprocessing to flexible multi-omics alignment.

### Adaptive immune receptor repertoire (AIRR)
