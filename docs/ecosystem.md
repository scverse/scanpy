If you'd like to see your tool included here, please open a [pull request](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy)!

With *ecosystem*, we mean the broader single-cell related tools that operate on {class}`~anndata.AnnData`.
If your tool doesn't do this, but is useful for analysing single cell data we also accept light wrappers for some tools in {mod}`scanpy.external`.
