## Scanpy hits 100 contributors! {small}`2022-03-31`

[100 people have contributed to Scanpy's source code!](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/graphs/contributors)

Of course, contributions to the project are not limited to direct modification of the source code.
Many others have improved the project by building on top of it, participating in development discussions, helping others with usage, or by showing off what it's helped them accomplish.

Thanks to all our contributors for making this project possible!

## New community channels {small}`2022-03-31`

We've moved our forums and have a new publicly available chat!

* Our discourse forum has migrated to a joint scverse forum ([discourse.scverse.org](https://discourse.scverse.org)).
* Our private developer Slack has been replaced by a public Zulip chat ([scverse.zulipchat.com](https://scverse.zulipchat.com)).

## Toolkit for spatial (squidpy) and multimodal (muon) published {small}`2022-02-01`

Two large toolkits extending our ecosystem to new modalities have had their manuscripts published!

* [Muon](https://muon.readthedocs.io/), a framework for multimodal has been published in [Genome Biology](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-021-02577-8).
* [Squidpy](https://squidpy.readthedocs.io/) a toolkit for working with spatial single cell data has been published in [Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01358-2).

## scVelo on the cover of Nature Biotechnology {small}`2020-12-01`

Scanpy's counterpart for RNA velocity, [scVelo](http://scvelo.org/), made it on the cover of [Nature Biotechnology](https://www.nature.com/nbt/volumes/38/issues/12) \[[tweet](https://twitter.com/NatureBiotech/status/1334647540030070792)\].

## Scanpy selected among 20 papers for 20 years of Genome Biology {small}`2020-08-01`

[Genome Biology: Celebrating 20 Years of Genome Biology](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/20years) selected the initial Scanpy paper for the year 2018 among 20 papers for 20 years \[[tweet](https://twitter.com/falexwolf/status/1295748952504045572)\].

## COVID-19 datasets distributed as `h5ad` {small}`2020-04-01`

In a joint initiative, the Wellcome Sanger Institute, the Human Cell Atlas, and the CZI distribute datasets related to COVID-19 via anndata's `h5ad` files: [covid19cellatlas.org](https://www.covid19cellatlas.org/). It wasn't anticipated that the [initial idea](https://falexwolf.de/blog/2017-12-23-anndata-indexing-views-HDF5-backing/) of sharing and backing an on-disk representation of `AnnData` would become so widely adopted. Curious? Read up more on the [format](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fileformat-prose.html).
