Introduces a `binary` method for `sc.pp.neighbors` that fully skips `umap` weighting of connectivities and thus returns `k` connectivities for `k` nearest-neighbors. It further includes a fix for the case in which custom neighbor transformers return less than k neighbors for some nodes (e.g., SNN and similar "adaptive" transformers). When `knn=True` and `method='umap'`, a warning is emitted snd specifies future behavior. The behavior of `n_neighbors` which differs depending on the nearest neighbor finder that is used internally is documented.
