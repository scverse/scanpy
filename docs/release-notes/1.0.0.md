### 1.0.0 {small}`2018-03-30`

```{rubric} Major updates
```

- Scanpy is much faster and more memory efficient: preprocess, cluster and
  visualize 1.3M cells in [6h], 130K cells in [14min], and 68K cells in [3min] {smaller}`A Wolf`
- the API gained a preprocessing function {func}`~scanpy.pp.neighbors` and a
  class {func}`~scanpy.Neighbors` to which all basic graph computations are
  delegated {smaller}`A Wolf`

```{warning}
```{rubric} Upgrading to 1.0 isnâ€™t fully backwards compatible in the following changes
```

- the graph-based tools {func}`~scanpy.tl.louvain`
  {func}`~scanpy.tl.dpt` {func}`~scanpy.tl.draw_graph`
  {func}`~scanpy.tl.umap` {func}`~scanpy.tl.diffmap`
  {func}`~scanpy.tl.paga` require prior computation of the graph:
  `sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=5); sc.tl.louvain(adata)` instead of
  previously `sc.tl.louvain(adata, n_neighbors=5)`
- install `numba` via `conda install numba`, which replaces cython
- the default connectivity measure (dpt will look different using default
  settings) changed. setting `method='gauss'` in `sc.pp.neighbors` uses
  gauss kernel connectivities and reproduces the previous behavior,
  see, for instance in the example [paul15].
- namings of returned annotation have changed for less bloated AnnData
  objects, which means that some of the unstructured annotation of old
  AnnData files is not recognized anymore
- replace occurances of `group_by` with `groupby` (consistency with
  `pandas`)
- it is worth checking out the notebook examples to see changes, e.g.
  the [seurat] example.
- upgrading scikit-learn from 0.18 to 0.19 changed the implementation of PCA,
  some results might therefore look slightly different
```

```{rubric} Further updates
```

- UMAP [^cite_mcinnes18] can serve as a first visualization of the data just as tSNE,
  in contrast to tSNE, UMAP directly embeds the single-cell graph and is faster;
  UMAP is also used for measuring connectivities and computing neighbors,
  see {func}`~scanpy.pp.neighbors` {smaller}`A Wolf`
- graph abstraction: AGA is renamed to [PAGA](https://github.com/theislab/paga): {func}`~scanpy.tl.paga`; now,
  it only measures connectivities between partitions of the single-cell graph,
  pseudotime and clustering need to be computed separately via
  {func}`~scanpy.tl.louvain` and {func}`~scanpy.tl.dpt`, the
  connectivity measure has been improved {smaller}`A Wolf`
- logistic regression for finding marker genes
  {func}`~scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups` with parameter `method='logreg'` {smaller}`A Wolf`
- {func}`~scanpy.tl.louvain` provides a better implementation for
  reclustering via `restrict_to` {smaller}`A Wolf`
- scanpy no longer modifies rcParams upon import, call
  `settings.set_figure_params` to set the 'scanpy style' {smaller}`A Wolf`
- default cache directory is `./cache/`, set `settings.cachedir` to change
  this; nested directories in this are avoided {smaller}`A Wolf`
- show edges in scatter plots based on graph visualization
  {func}`~scanpy.tl.draw_graph` and {func}`~scanpy.tl.umap` by passing `edges=True` {smaller}`A Wolf`
- {func}`~scanpy.pp.downsample_counts` for downsampling counts {smaller}`MD Luecken`
- default `'louvain_groups'` are called `'louvain'` {smaller}`A Wolf`
- `'X_diffmap'` contains the zero component, plotting remains unchanged {smaller}`A Wolf`
