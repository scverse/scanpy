# External API


```{eval-rst}
.. currentmodule:: scanpy.external
```

```{note}
More tools that integrate well with scanpy and anndata can be found on the {doc}`ecosystem page <../ecosystem>`.
```

Import Scanpy's wrappers to external tools as:

```
import scanpy.external as sce
```

If you'd like to include a tool here, consider making a pull request ({doc}`instructions <../dev/external-tools>`).
If the tool already uses `scanpy` or `anndata`, it may fit better in the {doc}`ecosystem page <../ecosystem>`.
