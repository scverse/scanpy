Contributing code
=================

Development workflow
--------------------

1. :ref:`Fork the Scanpy repository <forking-and-cloning>` to your own GitHub account
2. Create a :ref:`development environment <dev-environments>`
3. :ref:`Create a new branch <creating-a-branch>` for your PR
4. Add your feature or bugfix to the codebase
5. :ref:`Make sure all tests are passing <tests>`
6. :ref:`Build and visually check any changed documentation <building-the-docs>`
7. :ref:`Open a PR back to the main repository <open-a-pr>`

Code style
----------

New code should follow
`Black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style.html>`__
and Scanpyâ€™s
`EditorConfig <https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/blob/master/.editorconfig>`__,
so using an editor/IDE with support for both is helpful.
